\section{First Member}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
This is the best module that I have ever done in my life. Nottingham CompSci Legend Beve Stagley himself would be impressed by the \textbf{QUALITY} content of this module. 12/10 would recommend. G51FSE is love. G51FSE is life. Any day without an FSE lecture is not a day worth waking up for.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
In this module I have learned how software is built in teams, and the tools to enable this such as Git and LaTeX. I have learned about the different ways in which code can be developed such as Test Driven Development, including how to write unit tests using JUnit in Java.
