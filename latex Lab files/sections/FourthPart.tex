\subsection{Comments about the module}
	The module was fine initially, however I suddenly found it a lot more difficult to follow the JUnit testing when we were thrown into that for the assessed lab. This being said the rest of the course has been interesting and fairly straight-forward to follow. The added extra reading for each lab has been very beneficial to help me cement my understanding. I have found the content well structured and exciting, looking at software from a design perspective at a "high-level".
	Max has been an engaging lecturer with helpful personal quips given in each lecture. I have also been a lot more productive for me having the lecture videos uploaded as soon as the lecture is over (many lecturers don't do this), because I like to go home and re-watch to Google anything I didn't quite understand in the lecture.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
	I have learned the first steps of the larger software engineering process. I have learnt to gather requirements, make several designs well, plan the development, conduct the programming, have a testing strategy, test the parts of the system and the project as a whole, and have a maintenance strategy for it after it is delivered.
